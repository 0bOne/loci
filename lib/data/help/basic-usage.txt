Basic Usage:
------------
loci [switches] path [, path...]
    path: one or more paths (files or folders) to be included in the scan
    switches: options related to scanning

Switches:
---------
Include or exclude files, folders, languages, or extensions
(separate multiple values with semicolons)
--xn:<list>     excludes files with matching names. May be just the name name.extension
--xd:<list>     excludes files in folders with matching names
--xx:<list>     excludes files with matching extensions. use period, eg (.js;.config.xml)
                for any of the excludes, use the + symbol to indidate addition to the Defaults
                otherwise any defaults (eg .git) will be overwritten (and no longer ignored)
                example --xx:+myfolder1;myfolder2 
--i             case insensitive match of any excludes
--unique        only counts unique files.  Can take additional time.
--langs:<list>  a list of extension/language mappings. separate multiple with semicolons.
                if none supplied, list of supported languages will be displayed and execution will cease
                supply in the format  ext=language;...
                The language id must be available in the language definitions or an error will be thrown
                (See --show:languages below to view the list of supported languages)

Scanning Options:
--options:<value>   requires path to options file in json format 
                    These override the defaults 
                    They can can be overridden by environment variables and switches
--threads:<n>       Number of processing threads to use if more than 1000 files. Default is 4.
                    When there are less than 3500 files (see below) only one thread is used.
--tf:<n>            Minimum nummber of files required to invoke multi threaded mode. Defaults to 3500                    
--timeout:<n>       Number of seconds until threads timeout. Default is 20 minutes
--raster            Invokes experimental raster scan on languages with support for it (at this time only JavaScript)

Output:
--format:<format>  Format of output.
    Supported values for <format>:
        raw - raw JSON format as produced by the engine, unrounded times. Language counts are unsorted.
        json - cleaned JSON format, with times rounded to 100ths of a second
        text - console displayable text-based table, with dashes and tabs as cell borders
        xml - cleaned, sorted XML, using attributes
        html - cleaned, sorted HTML, using h2 and table tags
        csv - comma saparated values
    For all but RAW format, language counts are displayed in case-insentitive alphanumeric order
--scale    Multiply totals by language-specific scale factor
--to:<filespec>  Output to file instead of console
--suppress:<list> Suppress one more more components of the output:
    Separate multiple components with semicolons.
    Suppressible output components are:
        times  - Suppress the table of time statistics
        code   - Suppress individual code counts
        files  - Supporess the table of file statistics
        totals - Suppress the the sum of code statistcs at the bottom of the individual code counts list
        
Logging:
--verbosity=<level>     Information displayed while processing. One of silent, info, debug, thread. Defaults to silent.
                        Setting to 'debug' will cause the runtime options (aggregation of defaults, environment and switches) to be included in the output report
                        Setting to 'thread' shows only thread-related information

Data Help:
--show:defaults         Displays the default options JSON and exits 
--show:options          Shows the current options JSON (defaults and switches merged) and exits.
--show:languages        Shows the internal language definition YAML and exits.
                        These are the filtering rules that decide on the lines of code, comment, and blanks.
--show:disambiguation   Shows the internal language disambiguation definition YAML and exits.
                        These are the weighting rules that determine the language when it cannot be determined by file name or shebang
--show:environmentals   Show environment variable help and exits
